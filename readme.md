The Analytics Edge in Python

In 2015, [I](https://verify.edx.org/cert/2bd3b8210bdc455d8886fc0a1542623f) took [The Analytics Edge](https://www.edx.org/course/the-analytics-edge) course from edX. It has been my favorite course on analytics so far. The material was done in R. This repo is my attempt to redo some of the exercises in Python.
